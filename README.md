#### Tasks
- Step 1: Data Collection
Identify a suitable dataset for cancer diagnosis. Use a publicly available dataset (Kaggle dataset) on the assumption it has been provided by MD Anderson Cancer Institute. Ensure the dataset has a variety of features for the ANN to learn from. 

- Step 2: Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the data. Handle missing values, and outliers, and normalize the data as necessary.

- Step 3: Model Building
Build an ANN model using TensorFlow. Choose an appropriate number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer. Use appropriate activation functions.

- Step 4: Training
Train the model using your preprocessed data. Monitor the learning rate, loss function, and other relevant metrics to ensure the model is learning effectively

- Step 5: Evaluation 
Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Use a holdout validation set or cross-validation as per your preference.

- Step 6: Improvement
Based on your evaluation, identify areas where the model could improve. Tweak the model parameters, feature engineering, or data augmentation strategies to enhance model performance.

- Step 7: Documentation
Document your process, the challenges faced, and the solutions you came up with. Also, include your insights about the model's performance and potential applications in cancer diagnosis.
